  StoryText: "You reach the source of light, it seem to be a human village which was
    set on fire.\r\n\r\nAs you get closer a wretched smell reaches your nostrils.\r\n\r\nYou
    are still not close enough to get warm, but you can see multiple humans, coming
    from the village, walking towards you.\r\n\r\n1. Go towards the humans and village\r\n2.
    Run the other way"
