You slowly open your eyes as you feel a chilling breeze going through your fur and skin.

All around you is snow and white.

you must find a way to get warm soon or you will succumb to the cold.

 

In your sight you see a source of light in the distance, with smoke coming out of it.

Behind you can hear distant sounds of talk and laughter.

 

What do you do?

1. Go towards the light and smoke.

2. Go towards the voices.
